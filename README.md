cahn-hilliard
=============

Numerical solutions of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations
on various 1-D and 2-D domains.
Two considerably different approaches implemented:
1. Finite Element Method for solutions on irregular domains, implemented using FreeFEM++;
2. Discrete Cosine Transform for solutions on rectangular 1-D and 2-D domains.

For mathematical background, derivations and findings see `notes/ch.tex`.

This is my ancient research code (2006-2007),
recently (2014) taken over by others at ICM UW.
